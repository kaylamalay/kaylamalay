        <h3>Meet Kayla G.</h3>

<p> My name is Kayla Garrett. I am 17 years old. My birthday is September 17th, my sign is virgo. I'm a high school student, in the 11th grade. I attend Berkeley High School. I currently have a 3.0 gpa, for the first semester. However, in this second semester I'm aimming for an 3.5 or higher. The majority of my time is spent either at school or at my internship. I have a busy schedule during the week, because I'm constantly up and moving. I have an internship at Youth Radio. I have been attending Youth Radio, for about a year now. I started off as an intern, for 6 months. Then, applied for a job. My first job was as an Education Peer Teacher in Journalism. My current second job, here at Youth Radio is in the Mobile Action Lab. I coninue to come back and reapply because the environment is amazing. Plus, it's a way to get the Youth involved in things they are interseted in. We are young and coming up in the world.</p>

<h3>A Tad inDepth</h3>

<p> I have two bestfriends. One who has passed away, named Leneasha "Muffin" Northington. The other one name is Anaya Crucher. I have known the both of them since we were in elementary school.There is another girl, who I have met and grown closer with, who also falls in the bestfriend category. Her name is Donisha  Dansby. I spend most of my days communticating with these girls. I honestly think that I will continue to spend the remainer of my life with these very impo9rtant girls. I'm the only child. Therefore, my friends that are close to me are like my siblings in every way, except for the fact that we don't live together.</p>

<h3>Take Me Out</h3>

<p>Things I enjoy doing????? Well, I love love love icecream, there isn't a specific one that I like more then the other. I stopped eating all red meats on my quest to become a vegeterain. I taking very little steps to get there, and i have stayed fully commited to not eating any red meats. The idea of becoming a vegeterain came from watching a very interesting documentary. Something that stood out to me the most is the fact that eating animal products and processed foods increases Cancer growth. Before, becoming an "almost" vegeterian, I was eating steak almost every night. However, doing this has made me become more diciplined with myself. </p>
